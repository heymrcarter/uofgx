        <p>
          I had a great time building DCM and I learned a lot along the way.
          Since the release of Shadowkeep several API integrations with the
          Destiny 2 API have been broken. Also in that time I've purchased my
          first home, taken a new job, and have several other personal
          responsibilities that keep me from continuing to work on the site.
        </p>

        <p>
          Given my inability to continue to give DCM the time it demands to stay
          in tip top shape, I've made the difficult decision to let her go.
          Thank you to the great Destiny 2 community and my old clan, Unity of
          Guardians, who inspired me to create the site in the first place.
